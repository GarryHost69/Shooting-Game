# Shooting-Game

Made using p5.js, p5.dom.js and p5.sound.js

Press 's' to shoot bullets.

Press 'a' to move left, 'd' to move right.

Press spacebar to jump. In mid air you can press 'a' or 'd' to move in mid air. Recommended that the player holds the 'a' key since the game loops backwards holding key would provide a better mid air left movement. mid air right movement can be achieved with or without holding the 'd' key.  

Move your mouse around to change the angle of the gun in order to shoot targets at different angles. Nearly full 360 movement of gun is possible. Player can even choose to move the gun in mid air.

The Game loops backwards, so make sure to avoid the wall of spikes near the left end of the screen.

At the start of the game player will recieve 5 health bars. Each hit by the spiked wall and normal enemies would reduce each health bar by half. Some higher level enemies and final bosses would be able to deplete 1 or more health bar in a single strike.
